## Objectives

* To understand reusable UI components
* To design basic form and input elements
* To implement multiple UI components in React

---

## Tools Used

* React
* Vite
* JavaScript (JSX)

---

## Components Implemented

1. Button
2. TextField
3. Select (Dropdown)
4. Rating
5. Checkbox

All components are implemented in a **single App.jsx file**.

---

## Description

In this experiment, five commonly used UI components were created using React. These components are essential building blocks for modern web applications. The experiment demonstrates how React can be used to design interactive and reusable user interface elements efficiently.

---

## Output

* Button component responds to user interaction
* TextField accepts user input
* Select component displays dropdown options
* Rating component allows star selection
* Checkbox toggles selection state

---

## Advantages

* Simple and reusable UI components
* Easy to maintain
* Improves user interaction

---

## Result

Thus, **Experiment–2** was successfully completed by implementing five UI design components using React.

---

## Conclusion

This experiment helps in understanding the fundamentals of UI component creation in React, which is essential for building scalable front-end applications.
